# Product glossary

All UI copy uses these terms. Never use a retired term (see the end).
**One word per idea, one idea per word:** never introduce a synonym for a term
below, and never reuse a term below for a different idea.

**Scope:** every screen a member can see. Admin-only screens may say "Category";
nothing a member sees may. Marketplace copy is out of scope while the
marketplace is switched off.

**App name: Soosh** (formerly Sushii, and before that No Space). In code, always
read it from `APP_NAME` in `src/app/config.ts`; never hardcode the name in copy.
